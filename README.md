**FoxGate** `(formerly, FoxAntiVPN)` is a **powerful tool designed to protect your Minecraft server from unwanted visitors using VPNs.** This plugin prevents players from bypass ip bans by allowing server owners to detect and block **VPN's**, **Proxy's** and **more**. This plugin connects to a configerable list of services which detect VPN's without any hassel. **This plugin is extremely hard to bypass.** With numerous APIs working together, **bypassing this AntiVPN is very difficult**. The more services you enable, the harder it becomes for users to evade detection. Currently supporting **BungeeCord** `+ Forks`, **Velocity** `+ Forks` and **FOLIA**.
<br />
<br />
### Features:
- Supports different types of databases: **H2**, **SQLite**, **PostgreSQL**, **MySQL** and **MariaDB** with **HikariCP** connection.

        # The maximum number of connections in the connection pool.
        # - Determines the upper limit of active database connections that can be managed simultaneously.
        # - Setting this too high can overload your database server, while setting it too low can cause delays.
        # Example:
        #   If your server has high traffic and the database can handle it, set this to 10 or higher.
        # Recommended: 4
        # More information: https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP/wiki/About-Pool-Sizing
        maximum-pool-size: 4

        # Minimum number of idle connections to maintain in the pool.
        # - The pool will try to maintain this number of idle (inactive) connections ready for use.
        # - Setting this equal to 'maximum-pool-size' creates a fixed-size connection pool,
        #   ensuring consistent resource allocation.
        # Example:
        #   For a server with occasional traffic spikes, set this to half of 'maximum-pool-size'.
        # Recommended: 4
        minimum-idle: 4

        # Maximum lifetime of a connection in the pool, in milliseconds.
        # - Connections older than this value will be closed and replaced.
        # - This prevents stale connections from lingering indefinitely and reduces database timeout issues.
        # - Should be at least 30 seconds less than the timeout imposed by the database itself.
        # Example:
        #   If your database timeout is 30 minutes, set this value to 25 minutes (1500000 ms).
        # Recommended: 1500000 (25 minutes)
        maximum-lifetime: 1500000

        # Frequency of pings to keep the connection alive, in milliseconds.
        # - This prevents connections from being closed due to inactivity (common in many databases or firewalls).
        # - Must be less than 'maximum-lifetime' and greater than 30 seconds (30000 ms).
        # Example:
        #   For long-running servers, a value of 10 minutes (600000 ms) is generally ideal.
        # Recommended: 600000 (10 minutes)
        keepalive-time: 600000

        # The maximum time in milliseconds to wait for a connection from the pool.
        # - If no connection is available within this time, an exception will be thrown.
        # - Setting a low value ensures responsiveness but may cause issues under heavy load.
        # Example:
        #   For responsive applications, a value between 3-5 seconds (3000-5000 ms) is ideal.
        # Recommended: 5000 (5 seconds)
        connection-timeout: 5000

        # Custom validation timeout (time taken to validate a connection), in milliseconds.
        # - Determines how long the pool will wait while testing if a connection is still valid.
        # - A low value improves responsiveness, but setting it too low may cause false negatives.
        # Example:
        #   For most databases, 3 seconds (3000 ms) is sufficient for validation.

- This plugin has minimal performance impact due to it running **asynchronously**.
- Customize the messages how you want! This plugins supports **MiniMessage** and **Legacy** colors in all versions.
- The default config is setup to block most VPN's, although you can **[add a custom service](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/116596/field?field=documentation)** or **modify existing services in the config**.
- This plugin will automatically download lists of VPN's from services that don't have an API.


### Services available in the default config.
> **Do the services in the config works correctly?**
> The list of services in the default config have all been tested at least once. You can still configure each services values as well as edit or add more services (like in the example above). Services may not always function due to issues on their end or because of how they where added to the config. 

Some services are **disabled by default** because **they require an API key to function**. However, **ten of these services** work without a key and are enabled by default, providing basic **VPN** and **proxy** detection right away. To maximize protection against **VPNs**, **proxies**, and **other threats**, it is recommended to obtain API keys for the remaining services. Doing so will enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of detection.

**Want to know how to configure these services?** Check the configuration section below for examples and templates. When a player is detected using a **VPN** or **proxy**, the plugin automatically stores this information in a **database**. This prevents repeated **API requests** for the same **IP address** for a configurable number of hours, **reducing unnecessary API calls** and **improving efficiency**.

By using both services that are enabled-by-default and those that require API keys, you can create a robust detection system that effectively identifies and blocks **VPN**, **proxy**, and **other undesired connections**. See more information in the [**documentation section**](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/116596/field?field=documentation).
